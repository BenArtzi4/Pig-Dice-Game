## How to play:

1. The game is played by two players, and the goal is to be the first to reach a score of 100 points.
2. Each turn, a player rolls a dice. If the dice lands on 1, the player loses all their points for that turn and their turn ends. If the dice lands on any other number, the player has the option to continue rolling or to hold.
